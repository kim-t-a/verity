## Stage 0 — Inspect and plan ✅

**Goal:** understand the challenge, the starter kit and the environment before
writing any code.

### Findings

- `/mnt/d/rag` contained **only** the brief PDF and `mc3-starter-kit (1).zip`. No code
  had been extracted. It was **not a git repository**.
- The starter kit's CLI layer (`starter/app/app.py`) is **already correct**: argparse
  handles `--index` / `--corpus` / `--query-id` / `--query`, and the output JSON is
  written to the right path with the right schema. `index()` and `answer()` are stubs;
  `answer()` returns `("", [], 0.0)`, which is a contract-valid *refusal* and therefore
  scores 0/10 but never crashes.
- `AGENTS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` and `docs/` did not exist — they are
  outputs of this project, not inputs.
- Consulted documents: `CONTRACT.md`, `README.txt`, `starter/Dockerfile`,
  `starter/app/app.py`, `starter/app/requirements.txt`, `selfcheck.py`, `setup.sh`,
  `sample-questions.json`, every file in `mc3-corpus/`, and the full 8-page brief PDF.

### Environment facts established by experiment

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Project filesystem | `/mnt/d` is **9p/drvfs** (Windows `D:`) |
| `chmod 000` on `/mnt/d` | **No-op — read still succeeds.** Verified by experiment. |
| `chmod 000` on native fs (`/tmp`) | Correctly raises `Permission denied` |
| Laptop Python | 3.12.3 (image is 3.14 — wheel-availability risk) |
| System `pip` | absent, **but** `python3 -m venv` bootstraps `pip 24.0` offline ✅ |
| `git` | present |
| `docker` | present (Docker Desktop for Windows, invoked from WSL) |
| `unzip`, `tesseract` | **absent** |
| Third-party Python packages | none installed |

### Decisions taken

1. **Project root is `/mnt/d/rag`**, kit extracted **flattened** (kit root = repo
   root), so paths match the brief's layout and `setup.sh`'s relative paths.
2. **`setup.sh` was NOT run.** The committed corpus is pristine; the unreadable-file
   and empty-directory conditions are created by test fixtures on a native filesystem.
3. **venv lives at `~/venvs/mc3`** (native ext4), outside the repo, because the repo
   is on a slow 9p mount.
4. **The unreadable-file test must run against a native-filesystem copy** of the
   corpus. It cannot be exercised in place.
5. **Citations will be corpus-relative**, despite the brief saying absolute is also
   accepted, because `CONTRACT.md` and `selfcheck.py` both steer that way.
6. Architecture is **deterministic-first, model-assisted**: locate evidence, lift the
   exact span, prove the citations. A model is needed for images and disambiguation,
   not as the primary engine.

### Files created or modified

Extracted from `mc3-starter-kit (1).zip` (21 files, 8 directories, byte-for-byte
verified), plus:

- `.gitignore`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`

### Commands actually run

```bash
# Inspect zip structure and check for path traversal
python3 -I -c '...zipfile listing...'

# Extract, flattened, refusing to overwrite
python3 -I /tmp/mc3-tools/extract_kit.py "/mnt/d/rag/mc3-starter-kit (1).zip" /mnt/d/rag

# Verify byte-for-byte fidelity
python3 -I /tmp/mc3-tools/verify_kit.py "/mnt/d/rag/mc3-starter-kit (1).zip" /mnt/d/rag
```

### Test results

| # | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Extracted tree matches the zip (CRC-32 + size, 21 files / 8 dirs) | ✅ pass |
| 2 | `python3 -I starter/app/app.py` with no args → argparse error | ✅ pass |
| 3 | `--index` runs and creates the index dir | ✅ pass |
| 4 | `--query` writes a schema-valid refusal JSON | ✅ pass |
| 5 | `mc3-corpus/vendor/internal_audit.txt` readable (setup.sh not applied) | ✅ pass |
| 6 | `git log` shows the pristine initial commit; tree clean | ✅ pass |
| 7 | `~/venvs/mc3/bin/python -m pip --version` → pip 24.0 | ✅ pass |
| 8 | `pytest --collect-only` | ⏸ **not run** — pytest not yet installed (needs a small network download, awaiting approval) |

### Known bugs / unresolved risks

- **Python 3.12 (laptop) vs 3.14 (image).** No dependency may be considered safe
  until it installs inside the mandated image. Resolve in the first 30 minutes of
  the GPU session.
- **Image size budget.** Base is 29.2 GiB of 60 GiB, leaving ~30 GiB for weights and
  dependencies — roughly a 7–8B model at bf16. The binding limit is disk, not VRAM.
- **Per-question process ⇒ model reload × 10.** Must be solved with a resident worker
  behind a unix socket, with a fail-fast fallback.
- **"Section 2 of *All About the Challenges*"** is referenced by `CONTRACT.md` as
  authoritative for container rules but **was not supplied**. Worth requesting.
- **Citation paths discrepancy** between the brief and `CONTRACT.md` (see AGENTS.md).

### Work that requires the AMD GPU notebook

Everything that depends on real ROCm behaviour: base-image pull, wheel availability on
Python 3.14, `torch.__version__` staying `+rocm`, model load time, VRAM peak, real
vision accuracy, uncompressed image size, and `selfcheck.py`.

### Next step

**Stage 1 — Safe ingestion.** Install `pytest` into `~/venvs/mc3`, then implement
`ingestion/walker.py` (defensive traversal + failure ledger) with tests, using a
synthetic fixture corpus that reproduces all four hazards on a native filesystem.
